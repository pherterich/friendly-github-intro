        <h1>A Friendly Github Intro Workshop</h1>

        <p><strong>Adopted for the University of Birmingham, July 2019</strong></p>

        <h2 id="welcome">Welcome!</h2>
            <p>
                This is a friendly introduction to Github – a free and open source platform that can help you build projects that are collaborative, well documented, and version-controlled.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this workshop we will introduce you to the Github ecosystem and help you get you comfortable navigating basic Github workflows. We will make sure that you leave the workshop aware of the best practices for developing projects on Github (e.g. writing a good “readme” or posting and labeling issues) and an understanding of how Github can help make your projects more readable and accessible. We'll also introduce working locally and some of the command line options so you're ready to use these workflows in your day to day life!
            </p>
            <p>
                This workshop is developed for anyone looking for a solution to making projects – whether it be your research on arctic glaciers, the materials for an undergraduate course, your PHD thesis, or even a cookbook – more manageable. This workshop is geared towards all skill levels, but first-time and novice users are encouraged and prioritized.

            <li><strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KR23a71Gx-fmSuUyE0adApA-1hRhT972uIstIstMMr4/edit#slide=id.g11ce6fd2d6_0_182" target="blank">Working collaboratively with GitHub</a></strong> - In the previous talk, we saw how individually you might work on projects, this talk will show you two pathways for collaborating on GitHub.</li>
            <li><strong>Working locally using git</strong> - In the real world you'll probably want to work on your own computer and then keep the versions on GitHub. I will demo how you can use GitHub Desktop and maybe even the command line.
            <li><strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IVE5mx6tn6hUu7J0iRTH2ym6kT1HUsfDLmAsetrhG9A/edit#slide=id.g1568089626_4_61" target="blank">More things you can do with GitHub</a></strong> - Here we go through the essential components of a Github Repository.

        <h2 id="help">Help & code of conduct</h2>
          <h3>How can I ask questions?</h3>
          <p>
            Please feel free to ask the facilitators any questions you have - I'm here to help!
          </p>
          <p>
            You should also try asking your neighbours as you're working through the exercises. Figuring out how to do this in pairs is much easier than struggling alone!
          </p>
   

          <h3>Where can I find the workshop Code of Conduct?</h3>
            <p>
              You can find it <a href="https://www.mozillascience.org/code-of-conduct">here</a>. Remember that this workshop is aimed at beginners to git and GitHub, and there's no programming background required. It is very important that we ensure everyone feels welcome and that their contributions are valued. If you do not abide by the code of conduct and treat all members of the workshop with respect you will be asked to leave.
